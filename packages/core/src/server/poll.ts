/**
 * Polling-based change notification.
 *
 * Replaces SSE with a simple version counter. Each DB mutation (app-state,
 * settings, resources) increments the version. Clients poll `/_agent-native/poll?since=N`
 * and receive any events that occurred after version N.
 *
 * Works in all deployment environments (serverless, edge, long-lived).
 *
 * Also detects cross-process DB writes by periodically checking the
 * application_state and settings tables' updated_at timestamps. This ensures
 * that changes made by external processes (e.g., CLI actions, cron jobs)
 * are picked up even though they don't call recordChange() in this process.
