"@agent-native/core": patch
---

Add an optional `id` prop on `SettingsSection` so callers can deep-link or scroll to a specific section. The `agent-panel:open-settings` CustomEvent now accepts an optional `detail.section` field that AgentPanel forwards to the settings panel as `initialSection`. Rename the chat-history toggle copy to "All chats".
