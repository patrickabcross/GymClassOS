"@agent-native/core": patch

Stream `/_agent-native/events` SSE for in-process change events as the fast path for `useDbSync`, with the existing `/_agent-native/poll` endpoint as the cross-process / serverless fallback. When the SSE stream is connected, the polling interval relaxes to 15 s; if the server can't reach the client (or the consumer passes `sseUrl: false`), polling continues at the original cadence. Tool-call cards in `AssistantChat` now expose copy-to-clipboard buttons on the input and result panes.
