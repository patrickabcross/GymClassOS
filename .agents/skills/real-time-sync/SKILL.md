  How to keep the UI in sync with agent changes via SSE plus polling fallback.
  Use when wiring query invalidation for new data models, debugging UI not
  updating, or understanding jitter prevention.

# Real-Time Sync

## Rule

The UI stays in sync with agent/script changes through `useDbSync()`. In-process writes stream over `/_agent-native/events` first; `/_agent-native/poll` remains the cross-process/serverless fallback. When the agent writes to the database, the UI detects the change and updates automatically — no manual refresh needed.

## Why

The agent modifies data in SQL, but the UI runs in the browser. SSE bridges same-process writes immediately; polling bridges anything SSE cannot see, such as another serverless invocation, cron job, or external script. Every visible write increments a version counter, `useDbSync()` receives the change, and React Query invalidates the relevant caches. This is what makes database writes feel real-time without relying on aggressive polling.

## How It Works

1. **Server** increments a version counter on every database write. In-process events stream through the authenticated `/_agent-native/events` endpoint.

2. **Client** listens for SSE changes and invalidates React Query caches:

   ```ts
   import { useDbSync } from "@agent-native/core";
   useDbSync({ queryClient, queryKeys: ["items", "settings"] });
   ```

3. **Fallback** polling calls `/_agent-native/poll?since=N`. It runs every 2 seconds until SSE is connected, then relaxes to 15 seconds. If SSE is disabled or unavailable, polling continues at the normal cadence.

4. When the agent writes to the database, the version increments, SSE/polling detects it, and React Query refetches the affected queries.

## Don't

- Don't create manual polling loops — `useDbSync()` handles SSE plus fallback polling
- Don't create your own fetch-based polling alongside `useDbSync` — use the `onEvent` callback for custom handling

## Query Key Mapping

By default, `useDbSync` invalidates all listed query keys on every change. For apps with multiple data models, this causes unnecessary refetches. Use event-based filtering via the `onEvent` callback:

```ts
useDbSync({
  queryClient,
  queryKeys: [], // don't auto-invalidate everything
  onEvent: (data) => {
    if (data.source === "settings") {
      queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ["settings"] });
    } else if (data.source === "app-state") {
      queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ["navigate-command"] });
    } else {
      queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ["items"] });
    }
  },
});
```

To prevent cache thrashing during rapid agent writes, set `staleTime` on your queries:

```ts
useQuery({
  queryKey: ["items"],
  queryFn: fetchItems,
  staleTime: 2000, // don't refetch within 2 seconds
});
```

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom                            | Check                                                                                                          |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| UI not updating after agent writes | Is `useDbSync` called with the correct `queryClient`? Are the `queryKeys` matching your `useQuery` keys?       |
| Poll endpoint not responding       | Is `/_agent-native/poll` accessible? Is the server running?                                                    |
| SSE not connecting                 | Is `/_agent-native/events` accessible and authenticated? Polling should still keep the UI fresh as fallback.  |
| High CPU / event storms            | The agent is writing rapidly. Add `staleTime` to queries and use event-based filtering.                        |

## Jitter Prevention

When the agent writes to application-state via script helpers (`writeAppState`, `deleteAppState`), the write is automatically tagged with `requestSource: "agent"`. This prevents the UI from overwriting active user edits when it receives the change event.

### How it works

1. **Agent writes** are tagged: the script helpers in `@agent-native/core/application-state` pass `{ requestSource: "agent" }` to the store.
2. **UI writes** are tagged: templates send a per-tab ID via the `X-Request-Source` header on PUT/DELETE requests to application-state endpoints.
3. **Sync filters**: `useDbSync()` accepts an `ignoreSource` option. The UI passes its own tab ID so it ignores events from its own writes — but still picks up events from agents, other tabs, and scripts.

### Template setup

```ts
// app/lib/tab-id.ts
export const TAB_ID = `tab-${Math.random().toString(36).slice(2, 8)}`;

// app/root.tsx
import { TAB_ID } from "@/lib/tab-id";

useDbSync({
  queryClient,
  queryKeys: ["app-state", "settings"],
  ignoreSource: TAB_ID,
});
```

The `use-navigation-state.ts` hook sends the same `TAB_ID` in the `X-Request-Source` header when writing navigation state, so the tab that wrote the state does not refetch it.

### Why this matters

Without jitter prevention, a cycle occurs: the UI writes state, sync detects the change, the UI refetches and re-renders, potentially overwriting what the user is actively editing. With `ignoreSource`, the UI only reacts to changes from other sources (agent scripts, other browser tabs, other users).

## Action Routes and Polling

Action routes (`/_agent-native/actions/:name`) work with the same sync system. When a POST/PUT/DELETE action writes to the database, the version counter increments and `useDbSync` picks up the change. Frontend mutations via `useActionMutation` automatically invalidate `["action"]` query keys on success, triggering refetches of `useActionQuery` hooks.

### Auto-emit on mutating actions

The framework emits a poll event with `source: "action"` whenever any non-read-only action runs to completion — whether called via HTTP (`/_agent-native/actions/:name`) or as an agent tool call. Read-only actions (`http: { method: "GET" }` or explicit `readOnly: true`) are skipped.

This means UIs don't need the agent to remember to call `refresh-screen` after every mutation. A listener like this (used in the `macros` template) will refresh after any mutating agent call:

```ts
useDbSync({
  queryClient,
  queryKeys: [],
  ignoreSource: TAB_ID,
  onEvent: (data) => {
    if (data.requestSource === TAB_ID) return;
    // Invalidate all useActionQuery caches so list-*, get-*, etc. refetch
    queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ["action"] });
  },
});
```

`refresh-screen` remains available for unusual cases — e.g. the agent mutated data via a path the framework can't see (external system the app mirrors), or the agent wants to pass a `scope` hint for narrower invalidation.
