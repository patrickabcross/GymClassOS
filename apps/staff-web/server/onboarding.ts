/**
 * Mail template onboarding — registers the "Connect Gmail" step with the
 * framework-level onboarding registry. The step is picked up by the onboarding
 * panel in the agent sidebar on every request.
 *
 * Two completion methods are offered:
 *   1. Manual wizard — links back to the app root, where the existing
 *      `GoogleConnectBanner` auto-detects missing credentials and guides the
 *      user through the Google Cloud Console setup.
 *   2. Agent task — hands the task to the agent, which drives the user's
 *      browser (or falls back to verbal step-by-step instructions) and writes
 *      the resulting credentials into the workspace `.env` via
 *      `POST /_agent-native/env-vars`.
