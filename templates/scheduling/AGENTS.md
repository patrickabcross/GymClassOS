# Scheduling — Agent Guide

You are the AI assistant for this scheduling app. It supports 1:1
scheduling, team scheduling, routing forms, and workflows. This is an
**agent-native** app built with `@agent-native/core` and the
`@agent-native/scheduling` package.

**Core philosophy:** The agent and UI have full parity. Everything the user
sees, you can see via `view-screen`. Everything the user can do, you can
do via actions. The `<current-screen>` block is included with every message
automatically — call `view-screen` only when you need a refresh.

## Resources

At the start of every conversation, read the following, in both `personal`
and `shared` scopes:

1. `AGENTS.md` (this file plus user-added context)
2. `LEARNINGS.md`

Write to `LEARNINGS.md` when you pick up preferences or patterns.

## Skills

Read these before making changes to a given area:

- **scheduling-basics** — core concepts, terminology
- **event-types** — event type model, editor tabs, scheduling types
- **availability** — schedules, overrides, timezone rules
- **bookings** — lifecycle, reschedule, cancel, no-show
- **booker** — public booking flow + animations
- **slot-engine** — pure slot computation
- **team-scheduling** — round-robin, collective, host weights
- **integrations** — calendar + video providers
- **embeds** — inline / popup / floating-button embeds
- **workflows** — trigger-based automations
- **routing-forms** — pre-booking routing

The first four are must-reads for most tasks. The skill files live in
`.agents/skills/` and are symlinks into `@agent-native/scheduling/docs/skills/`.

## Architecture

- Frontend: React Router (SSR) with `@tanstack/react-query` polling for sync.
- Server: Nitro + Drizzle ORM. Works with SQLite, Postgres (Neon), Turso.
- Schema comes from `@agent-native/scheduling/schema` — don't duplicate.
- Server logic comes from `@agent-native/scheduling/server` (repos,
  availability engine, booking service, providers).
- Actions in `actions/` are mostly 1-line re-exports from the package.
  Replace a stub with a full `defineAction(...)` to override behavior.

## Common tasks

| User says                                             | You do                                                                                              |

## Multi-tenancy — orgs, teams, sharing

This template uses the framework's standard **organization** primitive
(`@agent-native/core/org`) as the top-level multi-tenant boundary, plus
**teams** as a sub-grouping inside an org. See `ORG_MODEL.md` in the
template root for the full picture.

- **Organization** = framework tenant. Tables: `organizations`,
  `org_members`, `org_invitations`. Switched via the sidebar `OrgSwitcher`.
- **Team** = slugged group of users within an org. Owns team event types,
  team workflows, the public `/team/:slug` page. Lives at `team_id` on
  event types / workflows / forms, with `org_id` on the team itself.
- **Resource visibility** — every user-authored resource (event type,
  schedule, booking, workflow, routing form) carries `owner_email`, `org_id`,
  and `visibility ∈ {private, org, public}` via `ownableColumns()`. Companion
  `{resource}_shares` tables hold per-user / per-org grants
  (`viewer | editor | admin`).
- **List actions** use `accessFilter(table, sharesTable)` to admit rows the
  current user owns, has been shared on, or that match
  org/public visibility within the active org.
- **Mutations** call `assertAccess(type, id, role)` before writing —
  `editor` for updates, `admin` for deletes, owner always satisfies.
- **Sharing actions** (auto-mounted, framework-wide):
  - `share-resource --resourceType <event-type|schedule|workflow|routing-form|booking|team> --resourceId <id> --principalType user|org --principalId <email-or-orgId> --role viewer|editor|admin`
  - `unshare-resource ...`
  - `list-resource-shares --resourceType <type> --resourceId <id>`
  - `set-resource-visibility --resourceType <type> --resourceId <id> --visibility private|org|public`

Public booking links (`/:user/:slug`, `/team/:slug`, `/d/:hash/:slug`,
`/forms/:formId`) intentionally bypass `accessFilter` — they serve
unauthenticated visitors who need to _book_. The sharing system gates who
can _manage_ a resource, not who can book against it.

## Conventions

- **Use shadcn/ui** from `app/components/ui/`. Never roll your own Dialog /
  Popover / Select with absolute positioning.
- **Use Tabler icons** (`@tabler/icons-react`). No Lucide, no inline SVGs,
  no emoji icons.
- **No browser dialogs** (`window.confirm/alert/prompt`) — use
  `AlertDialog` from shadcn.
- **Keep shadcn default transitions** (animate-in/out, fade, zoom, slide) —
  never strip them. Purposeful custom transitions that communicate a state
  change and match shadcn's motion (short, ease-out, `data-[state]`-gated)
  are fine; avoid slow or decorative animation. Framer-motion is allowed for
  booker stage transitions where a continuous, animated feel is the intended
  product polish. See the `shadcn-ui` skill → Transitions And Motion.
- **Use shadcn's default pill tabs** for the event type editor — not
  MUI-style underline tabs.
- **Call view-screen first** when the user's request is ambiguous about
  what they're looking at.
- **Optimistic UI by default** — never `await` a server round-trip before
  updating the screen for routine mutations. See the framework `AGENTS.md`
  for the full pattern.

## Shared booking-link components

Event-type editor UI (Setup tab conferencing row, URL slug editor, custom
fields, duration picker, create dialog) is supplied by the scheduling
package — see `@agent-native/scheduling/react/components`. Prefer editing
the package component over forking. Current exports:

- `ConferencingSelector` — no-conf / Google Meet / Zoom / Custom grid. Zoom
  uses real OAuth (`connect-video` action).
- `SlugEditor` — inline-editable URL preview.
- `CustomFieldsEditor` — add/edit/reorder booking-form fields.
- `DurationPicker` — multi-select duration pills.
- `BookingLinkCreateDialog` — title/URL/duration modal.

Details in `packages/scheduling/docs/UI_UNIFICATION.md`.
