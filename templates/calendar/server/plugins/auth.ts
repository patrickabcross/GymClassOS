// Calendar requires a Google connection to read/write events, so the
// onboarding page only offers "Sign in with Google" — no email/password
// account creation, since that path can't be used to access the calendar.
//
// Calendar/Contacts/Directory scopes are requested up front during the
// primary "Sign in with Google" flow. Tokens land in the framework's
// `oauth_tokens` table automatically (via a Better Auth account hook)
// so the existing `templates/calendar/server/lib/google-calendar.ts`
// client works on first sign-in — no separate "Connect Google" page
// needed. The template-specific routes under `/_agent-native/google/*`
// remain available for "add another account" flows.
