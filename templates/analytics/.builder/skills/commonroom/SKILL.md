| Route                         | Description              |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `GET /api/commonroom/members` | Search community members |

## Script Usage

```bash

pnpm action commonroom-members --email=user@example.com

# Search by query
pnpm action commonroom-members --query=search_term

# List segments
pnpm action commonroom-members --segments
```

## Key Patterns & Gotchas

- `getMemberByEmail` uses POST `/members/search` and returns single `CommunityMember` or null on error
- API returns `{ items: ... }` wrappers or raw arrays — code handles both
- Use for finding community engagement signals to enrich customer profiles
