## Text animations

Based on `useCurrentFrame()`, reduce the string character by character to create a typewriter effect.

## Typewriter Effect

Always use string slicing for typewriter effects. Never use per-character opacity.

## Word Highlighting

Animate a highlight behind words using interpolation on width/background properties.
