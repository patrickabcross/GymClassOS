Use `<Sequence>` with a negative `from` value to trim the start of an animation.

## Trim the Beginning

```tsx
const { fps } = useVideoConfig();

<Sequence from={-0.5 * fps}>
  <MyAnimation />
</Sequence>;
```

## Trim the End

```tsx
<Sequence durationInFrames={1.5 * fps}>
  <MyAnimation />
</Sequence>
```

## Trim and Delay

Nest sequences to both trim the beginning and delay:

```tsx
<Sequence from={30}>
  <Sequence from={-15}>
    <MyAnimation />
  </Sequence>
</Sequence>
```
