Use `<Sequence>` to delay when an element appears in the timeline.

```tsx
import { Sequence } from "remotion";

const { fps } = useVideoConfig();

<Sequence from={1 * fps} durationInFrames={2 * fps} premountFor={1 * fps}>
  <Title />
</Sequence>;
```

Always premount any `<Sequence>`!

## Series

Use `<Series>` when elements should play one after another without overlap.

```tsx
import { Series } from "remotion";

<Series>
  <Series.Sequence durationInFrames={45}>
    <Intro />
  </Series.Sequence>
  <Series.Sequence durationInFrames={60}>
    <MainContent />
  </Series.Sequence>
</Series>;
```

## Frame References Inside Sequences

Inside a Sequence, `useCurrentFrame()` returns the local frame (starting from 0).

## Nested Sequences

Sequences can be nested for complex timing:

```tsx
<Sequence from={0} durationInFrames={120}>
  <Background />
  <Sequence from={15} durationInFrames={90} layout="none">
    <Title />
  </Sequence>
</Sequence>
```
