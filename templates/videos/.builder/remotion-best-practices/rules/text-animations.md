## Text animations

Based on `useCurrentFrame()`, reduce the string character by character to create a typewriter effect.

## Typewriter Effect

Always use string slicing for typewriter effects. Never use per-character opacity.

## Word Highlighting

Animate word highlights like a highlighter pen by interpolating the width of a background element behind each word.
