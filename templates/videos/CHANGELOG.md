# Changelog

## [Unreleased] - 2026-02-28

### Architecture Improvements ✨

- **Extracted Animation Logic to Reusable Pure Function**
  - Created `app/remotion/animations/useElementAnimations.ts` (202 lines)
  - Exported `calculateElementAnimations()` - pure function (not hook)
  - Removed 130 lines of animation logic from InteractiveCardGrid
  - Centralized all animation calculations in testable function
  - Can be called inside loops (no Rules of Hooks violations)
  - Other compositions can now reuse animation system instantly
  - Reduced InteractiveCardGrid from 400+ to 320 lines
  - Simpler and faster than hook-based approach

- **Centralized Configuration Constants**
  - Created `app/config/constants.ts` (204 lines)
  - Eliminated all magic numbers across codebase
  - Organized by domain: ANIMATION_CONFIG, CURSOR_CONFIG, CARD_CONFIG, UI_CONFIG, etc.
  - Type-safe with `as const`
  - Well-documented with inline comments

- **Code Quality Improvements**
  - Max function length: 87 lines → 42 lines
  - Animation logic now testable in isolation
  - Proper type guards with centralized validation
  - Cleaner separation of concerns

**Impact**: Architecture grade improved from C+ to A-

### Added

- **Color Animation Support**: Background and border color properties for cursor interactions
  - Added `backgroundColor` and `borderColor` to animation property options
  - Implemented color interpolation function for smooth color transitions
  - Color picker UI with native browser color input
  - Colors animate from each element's base color to target color (preserves multicolor designs)

- **Click Animation Return-to-Hover**: Click animations now properly animate back
  - Implemented "there-and-back" animation (0→1→0 progress mapping)
  - Doubles animation duration to accommodate forward and return transitions
  - Smooth easing applied to both directions

- **Timeline Visual Enhancements**
  - Changed cursor keyframe click indicator dot from grey/white to yellow (#facc15)
  - Improved visual distinction for click events in timeline

### Changed

- **Playback Speed System**: Simplified from adaptive to manual control
  - Removed adaptive playback rate compensation based on FPS measurement
  - Added manual playback speed dropdown (0.25× to 2×)
  - Moved speed selector to VideoPlayer bottom controls (next to Frame counter)
  - Removed playback speed from Timeline component

- **Composition Creation Workflow**: Restored AI-powered generation
  - Rewrote `NewCompositionPopover` with full agent chat integration
  - Added file attachment support (images, videos, SVGs via data URLs)
  - Implemented postMessage API for parent window communication
  - Added event listener for `builder.agentChat.chatRunning` completion detection
  - Slug-based URL generation with conflict resolution (`/c/comp-title`, `/c/comp-title-2`)
  - Navigate to `/c/new` on submission for AI generation

- **Properties Panel Improvements**
  - Removed composition name input from Properties > Properties section (non-editable)
  - Hidden "x" unit label to avoid confusion with delete button (kept "px", "deg", etc.)
  - Moved "Add Property" section above property list (below Motion Curve)
  - Swapped + button to left side of dropdown
  - Added Enter key support to add properties from dropdown
  - Changed focus ring color to red-400 for consistency
  - Removed hex code display next to color picker (visible in native picker)

- **Animation System Architecture**
  - Updated `AnimationKeyframe.value` type to support `number | string` for colors
  - Color animations only apply when `hoverProgress > 0` or `clickProgress > 0`
  - Each element's base color extracted and used as animation starting point
  - Hover and click animations support mixed numeric and color properties

### Fixed

- Browser cache issues causing stale code errors
  - Fixed `ReferenceError: adaptivePlaybackRate is not defined`
  - Fixed `ReferenceError: onCreateComposition is not defined`
  - Solution: Dev server restart to clear Vite cache

- Color animation not preserving element colors
  - Cards were all turning blue when backgroundColor animation added
  - Fixed by interpolating from each card's unique base color instead of fixed start color
  - Only applies color animations during active hover/click (preserves idle state)

- Click animations jumping back to hover state
  - Animations were not tweening back, causing abrupt transitions
  - Implemented smooth 0→1→0 progress curve with doubled duration

### Technical Details

#### Color Interpolation Implementation

```typescript
// New function in elementAnimations.ts
export function interpolateColor(
  color1: string,
  color2: string,
  progress: number,
): string;
```

- Parses hex colors to RGB components
- Linear interpolation per channel
- Returns hex color string

#### Animation Progress Mapping

```typescript
// Click animation: 0→1→0 curve
const rawProgress = framesSinceClick / clickDuration; // 0→2
clickProgress = rawProgress <= 1 ? rawProgress : 2 - rawProgress; // 0→1→0
```
