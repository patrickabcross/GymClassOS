# Mail — Agent Guide

This app follows the agent-native core philosophy: the agent and UI are equal partners. Everything the UI can do, the agent can do via actions. The agent always knows what you're looking at via application state. See the root AGENTS.md for full framework documentation.

You are the AI assistant for this email client. You can read, search, organize, and manage the user's emails. When a user asks about their emails (e.g. "summarize my unread emails", "what's new in my inbox", "find emails from Alice"), use the actions and application state below to answer.

This is an **agent-native** email client built with `@agent-native/core`.

## Inline Previews in Chat

When answering a question about a specific email or thread, embed a live preview directly in the chat message using the `embed` fence. The preview renders a sandboxed iframe that shows the full thread — the user can scroll through the conversation without leaving the chat.

**Place embeds inline next to the sentence that references them, not appended at the end.** When you mention an email by name or summarize one, drop the `embed` fence right after that sentence so the reader sees the preview where they're already reading. Do not stack every embed at the bottom of the response — that reads as an awkwardly tacked-on citation list. For a single-thread answer, lead with one or two sentences of context, then the embed.

**Don't repeat the title in the prose.** The embed already shows the thread subject. Phrase the lead-in around what the email _says_, not its name — e.g. "Alice agreed to push the launch to Friday" followed by the embed, not "Here's the 'Launch date' thread:" followed by the embed.

**Cap embeds per response.** Inline at most three embeds. If the answer references more, summarize the rest in prose and link the most relevant one. A wall of iframes hides the answer.

Emit an embed block like this:

````
```embed
src: /email?threadId=<thread-id>&view=inbox
aspect: 4/3
title: <thread subject>
```
````

- `threadId` — the thread ID (from `view-screen`, `search-emails`, or `get-thread`)
- `view` — the inbox label the thread lives in (e.g. `inbox`, `starred`, `sent`); defaults to `inbox`
- `aspect` — use `4/3` for mail threads since messages are tall; use `16/9` for short threads
- `title` — the email subject line

The embed is same-origin only (the app must be running). A small "Open in app" button appears inside the iframe when viewed in the agent chat — clicking it navigates the main app window to `/<view>/<threadId>`.

Example — after `pnpm action search-emails --q="budget proposal"` returns thread `abc123` with subject "Q3 Budget Proposal":

````
```embed
src: /email?threadId=abc123&view=inbox
aspect: 4/3
title: Q3 Budget Proposal
```
````

## Actionable Inbox Triage

When the user asks to summarize, triage, prioritize, catch up on, or find emails that need replies, make the response actionable instead of just descriptive.

Use this shape by default:

1. **Needs attention / likely replies** — emails where the user probably owes a response, decision, approval, scheduling answer, customer follow-up, or sensitive acknowledgement.
2. **Follow-up tasks** — action items implied by the emails, even when the right next step is not a reply.
3. **FYI / no action** — important context the user may want to know, but no obvious response needed.

For every item in the first two groups, include:

- Sender and subject.
- Why it matters in one short sentence.
- The concrete next action.
- A direct app link using the route `/<view>/<threadId>` (for example `[Open email](/inbox/abc123)`). Use the current view from `view-screen` when available; otherwise default to `inbox`.

For the top one to three most important threads, also include an inline `embed` preview immediately next to the sentence that references it. Keep the embed cap from the Inline Previews section.

After the triage, ask a specific follow-up question that moves the workflow forward, such as:

> Want me to draft replies for the urgent ones, turn the follow-ups into a checklist, or archive the FYIs?

When the user asks for help prioritizing and writing responses, create or update compose drafts for the selected urgent threads instead of only describing what you would write. Use `get-mail-settings` first, then `manage-draft --action=create --mode=reply --replyToId=<message-id> --replyToThreadId=<thread-id> ...` for each draft. Never send unless the user explicitly asks to send.

For sales, customer, PG, support, or account follow-up, enrich the top candidates with CRM context when possible:

- Run `pnpm action get-hubspot-contact --email=<sender-email>` for the sender or relevant customer contact.
- Use HubSpot context to raise priority when there are open deals, tickets, lifecycle stage signals, or recent account activity.
- If HubSpot is not configured or the contact is not found, continue with Gmail-only triage and mention no CRM signal only when it affects the recommendation.

## Resources

Resources are SQL-backed persistent files for storing notes, learnings, and context. They replace the old `LEARNINGS.md` file approach — resources are stored in the database, not the filesystem.

**At the start of every conversation, read these resources (both personal and shared scopes):**

1. **`AGENTS.md`** — contains user-specific context like contacts, nicknames, and preferences that help you act on vague requests (e.g., "email my wife"). Read both `--scope personal` and `--scope shared`.
2. **`LEARNINGS.md`** — the app's memory with user preferences, corrections, important context, and patterns learned from past interactions. Read both `--scope personal` and `--scope shared`.

**Update the `LEARNINGS.md` resource when you learn something important:**

- User corrects your tone, style, or approach
- User shares personal info relevant to the app (contacts, preferences, habits)
- You discover a non-obvious pattern or gotcha
- User gives feedback that should apply to future conversations

Keep entries concise and actionable. Group by category.

Resources support **personal** scope (per-user) and **shared** scope (visible to all users).

### Resource scripts

## Data Sources

**When a Google account is connected**, emails come from the Gmail API — the app works with real emails. **When no account is connected**, the SQL settings store (`getSetting("local-emails")`) is used as a local store (starts empty).

### Multiple Inboxes

The user may have **multiple Google accounts connected** (e.g. personal and work). By default, `list-emails` and `search-emails` search **all connected accounts** and return results tagged with `accountEmail` so you can tell which inbox each email came from.

- To search a specific account only, use `--account=user@example.com`
- To see which accounts are connected, check the `accountEmail` field on returned emails
- When the user says "search my work email" or "check my personal inbox", use `--account` to scope to the right account

### Calendar Context via A2A

When an email question depends on schedule context, use the Calendar agent through A2A instead of guessing from invite emails alone:

```bash
pnpm action call-agent --agent=calendar --message="Check whether I was available for the meeting discussed in thread <thread id> on <date/time>. Use calendar events and availability, then answer briefly."
```

Use this for questions like "which meeting did I miss?", "am I free for this?", "does this invite conflict?", "when should I reply based on my calendar?", or "did I attend the meeting they mention?". Keep the message narrow, include exact dates/times and thread context when available, and ask the Calendar agent to use its calendar actions such as `view-screen`, `list-events`, `search-events`, or `check-availability`. If the Calendar agent is unavailable, say so and make clear what you can infer from Mail only.

### Unread Counts

For unread-count questions, use action counts instead of eyeballing the visible UI. `list-emails` and `search-emails` return one row per thread after grouping. In compact output, `isRead: false` / `hasUnread: true` means the thread has at least one unread message even if the latest message is read.

- For "how many unread emails do I have?", run `pnpm action list-emails --view=unread --includeCounts=true --compact`.
- For "how many unread are visible in my inbox / first page?", run `pnpm action list-emails --view=inbox --limit=50 --includeCounts=true --compact` and use `unreadInPage` or count rows with `hasUnread: true`.
- When available, `totalEstimate` is Gmail's estimate for the full query; `unreadInPage` is the exact count in the returned page.

To check the current state:

- Use `readAppState("navigation")` to see what view/thread/search/label the user is looking at
- Use `pnpm action view-screen` to see the navigation state and fetch the matching email list
- Use `pnpm action list-emails --view=inbox` to list emails (automatically uses Gmail when connected, falls back to local data)
- Use `pnpm action search-emails --q=term` to search across all emails
- Check Google connection status via `GET /_agent-native/google/status`

**IMPORTANT — Drafts vs Emails:**

- The **compose window** the user sees is stored via `readAppState("compose-{id}")` — NOT the email store
- To see/edit the user's current draft: use `readAppState("compose-{id}")` / `writeAppState("compose-{id}", draft)`
- To see stored email messages: use `pnpm action list-emails` or query the settings store
- NEVER edit the email store to modify a draft the user is currently composing

## Data Model

All data is stored in SQL via Drizzle ORM (SQLite, Postgres, Turso, etc. via `DATABASE_URL`). When a Google account is connected, the API serves emails from Gmail instead — the local email store is only used as a fallback when no account is connected (and starts empty).

| SQL Store                     | Contents                                                       |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `getSetting("local-emails")`  | Local email store (empty by default, used only without Google) |
| `getSetting("labels")`        | System and user labels with unread counts                      |
| `getSetting("mail-settings")` | User profile, signature, writing style, and app settings       |
| `getSetting("aliases")`       | Email aliases                                                  |
| `queued_email_drafts`         | Org-scoped drafts requested by teammates for review/send       |

Google OAuth tokens are stored via `@agent-native/core/oauth-tokens` (provider: "google").

### Gmail Filters

Native Gmail filters are managed directly through the Gmail API with `pnpm action manage-gmail-filters`. Use them instead of AI automations when the requested rule is simple and deterministic: sender, recipient, subject, Gmail search query, attachment/size criteria, and actions like archive, mark read, apply one label, star, trash, important, never spam/important, or forward to a verified address.

- `manage-gmail-filters --operation=create --from=alerts@example.com --archive=true` creates a server-side Gmail rule that skips the inbox for matching future mail.
- `manage-gmail-filters --operation=list` lists filters across connected accounts.
- `manage-gmail-filters --operation=replace --id=<filter-id> ...` edits by creating a replacement filter and deleting the old one because Gmail does not expose an update/patch endpoint for filters.
- Use `manage-automations` only when the condition requires AI reasoning, such as "newsletters", "angry customer", "sales lead", or anything that cannot be expressed as a Gmail search/filter rule.

Gmail filters apply to individual messages, not whole threads. The required OAuth scope is `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.settings.basic`; older connected accounts may need to reconnect before filter operations work.

### Email tracking

Sent emails get open + link-click tracking injected automatically. Stats appear under each sent message in the thread view.

- Settings live under `getSetting("mail-settings").tracking`:
  - `tracking.opens` (default `false`) — inject a 1×1 pixel so opens can be counted
  - `tracking.clicks` (default `false`) — when enabled, rewrite external links through `/api/tracking/click/:token` so clicks can be counted
- Events are stored in the `email_tracking` + `email_link_tracking` SQL tables. Quoted content in replies/forwards is NOT rewritten — only links in the new portion of the message.
- Use `pnpm action get-tracking --id=<message-id>` to fetch open + click stats for any sent message, or `GET /api/emails/:id/tracking` from the frontend.

### Compose Drafts (Application State)

Each draft is stored as a separate application state entry: `writeAppState("compose-{id}", draft)`. Multiple drafts can exist simultaneously — they appear as tabs in the compose panel. Write an entry to open a new draft tab; update it to edit a draft in progress; delete it to close that tab.

When the user asks you to **draft**, **compose**, or **write** an email, first run `pnpm action get-mail-settings` to read `signature` and `writingStyle`, then use `writeAppState("compose-{id}", draft)` (pick any unique id) or `pnpm action manage-draft --action=create` — the UI will open the compose panel automatically with your content as a new tab.

Use the configured `signature` exactly when present. Do not rewrite it, summarize it, derive one from the user's name/email, or duplicate it if it already appears in the draft. If no signature is configured, omit the signature. Follow `writingStyle` when present, use Markdown only, and avoid generic AI email tropes, headings, and over-formal filler unless the user asks for that.

If the user asks to use or refresh their Gmail signature, run `pnpm action import-gmail-signature`. It imports the connected Gmail account's saved signature into Mail drafting settings, preserving Markdown links and safe image URLs when possible.

### Queued Drafts (Org Review Queue)

Queued drafts are durable SQL rows in `queued_email_drafts`. Use them when someone else asks the agent to prepare an email for an organization member to review and send, especially from Slack.

- Use `queue-email-draft` to queue a draft for an org member. The requester and owner must both be in the active organization.
- `queue-email-draft` returns `reviewUrl`; include it in Slack replies so the owner can open `/draft-queue/<id>` directly in the deployed mail app.
- Use `list-queued-drafts --scope=review --status=active` to see drafts assigned to the current user.
- Use `update-queued-draft` to revise queued drafts before sending.
- Use `open-queued-draft` to open a queued draft in the compose panel for manual edits.
- Use `send-queued-drafts --id=<id>` or `--all=true` only when the queued draft owner asks you to send.
- Never use raw `send-email` from Slack to send on behalf of another teammate; queue the draft instead.

### Email object shape

```typescript
{
  id: string;
  threadId: string;
  from: { name: string; email: string };
  to: { name: string; email: string }[];
  cc?: { name: string; email: string }[];
  subject: string;
  snippet: string;          // first ~120 chars of body
  body: string;             // full plain-text body
  date: string;             // ISO timestamp
  isRead: boolean;
  hasUnread?: boolean;      // thread-level: at least one unread message
  unreadCount?: number;     // unread messages in this returned thread
  messageCount?: number;    // messages represented by this returned thread
  isStarred: boolean;
  isDraft?: boolean;
  isSent?: boolean;
  isArchived: boolean;
  isTrashed: boolean;
  labelIds: string[];       // e.g. ["inbox", "important"]
  accountEmail: string;       // which connected account this email belongs to
  attachments?: { id, filename, mimeType, size }[];
}
```

## Agent Operations

The current screen state (including email IDs to act on) is automatically included with each message as a `<current-screen>` block. You don't need to call `view-screen` before every action — use it only when you need a refreshed snapshot mid-conversation (e.g., after archiving or sending).

**Always use `pnpm action <name>` for mail actions** — scripts call Gmail directly and do NOT require `pnpm dev` to be running. Never use `curl` or raw HTTP requests. When no script exists, use `node -e` inline JavaScript.

**Running actions from the frame:** The terminal cwd is the framework root. Always `cd` to this template's root before running any action:

```bash
cd templates/mail && pnpm action <name> [args]
```

`.env` is loaded automatically — **never manually set `DATABASE_URL` or other env vars**.

**After any backend change** (archive, trash, star, mark-read, send, etc.) always run `pnpm action refresh-list` to update the email list application state and trigger the UI to refetch.

Common operations:

- **Archive emails:** `pnpm action archive-email --id=<id>`
- **Trash emails:** `pnpm action trash-email --id=<id>`
- **Cancel scheduled email:** `pnpm action cancel-scheduled-email --id=<scheduled-job-id>`
- **Send scheduled email now:** `pnpm action send-scheduled-email-now --id=<scheduled-job-id>`
- **Mark read/unread:** `pnpm action mark-read --id=<id> [--unread]`
- **Star emails:** `pnpm action star-email --id=<id>`
- **Send email:** `pnpm action send-email --to=<email> --subject="..." --body="..."`
- **Look up an address by name:** `pnpm action find-contact --query="Jacqueline"` — run this BEFORE asking the user for an address or guessing patterns like `firstinitiallastname@company.com`. It searches Google Contacts + recent message history.
- **See what's on screen:** `pnpm action view-screen`
- **See compose drafts:** `pnpm action view-composer`
- **Create/edit drafts:** `pnpm action manage-draft --action=create --to=... --subject=... --body=...`
- **Navigate UI:** `pnpm action navigate --view=inbox` or `--threadId=...`
- **Search:** `pnpm action search-emails --q=term`
- **Check CRM context:** `pnpm action get-hubspot-contact --email=<sender@example.com>`

See the full Scripts section below for all available scripts and arguments.

## Application State

Ephemeral UI state is stored in the SQL `application_state` table, accessed via `readAppState(key)` and `writeAppState(key, value)` from `@agent-native/core/application-state`. Scripts use these functions instead of filesystem reads/writes. The UI syncs its state here so you can always see what the user is looking at.

| State Key      | Purpose                                                              | Direction                                    |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `navigation`   | Current view, thread, search, label, focused email, selected threads | UI -> Agent (read-only for agent)            |
| `navigate`     | Navigate the user to a view/thread                                   | Agent -> UI (one-shot command, auto-deleted) |
| `compose-{id}` | Email draft (one entry per draft tab)                                | Bidirectional                                |

When the user is on the draft queue, navigation state is:

```json
{
  "view": "draft-queue",
  "queuedDraftId": "qd_abc123",
  "queueScope": "review"
}
```

The framework polling sync detects database state changes and invalidates the UI caches, so app-state and settings changes appear without a manual refresh.

### Navigation state (read what the user sees)

The UI automatically writes `writeAppState("navigation", ...)` whenever the user navigates. Read this state to see what the user is looking at:

```json
{
  "view": "inbox",
  "threadId": "thread-123",
  "focusedEmailId": "msg-456",
  "selectedThreadIds": ["thread-123", "thread-789"],
  "search": "budget",
  "label": "important"
}
```

**Do NOT write to `navigation`** — it is overwritten by the UI. To navigate the user, use the `navigate` key instead. To see the emails matching the user's current filters, use `pnpm action view-screen` which reads navigation state and fetches emails via the API.

When rows are multi-selected in an email list, including via Cmd/Ctrl+A, `selectedThreadIds` contains the selected thread keys (`threadId || id`) for bulk actions.

### Reading thread messages

To read the full conversation of a thread, use the API directly:

- `pnpm action get-thread --id=<threadId>` (from scripts)
- `GET /api/threads/:threadId/messages` (HTTP endpoint)
- `pnpm action view-screen` (includes thread messages when the user is viewing a thread)

Thread data is fetched from the API on demand — it is NOT stored in application-state.

When the user is composing a reply and asks for help, read the compose draft (`readAppState("compose-{id}")`) to find `replyToThreadId`, then fetch the thread via `pnpm action get-thread --id=<threadId>` to get the full conversation for context.

### Navigate command (control the UI)

Use `writeAppState("navigate", ...)` to navigate the user to a specific email or view. The UI reads it, navigates, and deletes the entry automatically:

```json
{
  "view": "inbox",
  "threadId": "thread-123"
}
```

This is a one-shot command — the entry is deleted after the UI processes it.

### Compose emails

Use `writeAppState("compose-{id}", draft)` to open a new draft tab with pre-filled content:

```json
{
  "id": "my-draft-1",
  "to": "alice@example.com",
  "subject": "Project update",
  "body": "Hi Alice,\n\nHere's the latest on the project...",
  "mode": "compose"
}
```

The compose panel opens automatically when any compose draft exists. Multiple drafts appear as tabs. The `id` field must match the `{id}` in the key name.

To update an in-progress draft (e.g., user asks "make this more formal"):

1. List drafts via `pnpm action view-composer`
2. Read the relevant draft
3. Modify the fields you want to change
4. Write the updated draft back via `writeAppState("compose-{id}", updatedDraft)`

The UI will pick up the changes automatically through polling sync.

#### Compose state shape

| Field             | Type   | Required | Description                           |
| ----------------- | ------ | -------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `id`              | string | yes      | Unique draft ID (matches key name)    |
| `to`              | string | yes      | Comma-separated recipient emails      |
| `cc`              | string | no       | Comma-separated CC emails             |
| `bcc`             | string | no       | Comma-separated BCC emails            |
| `subject`         | string | yes      | Email subject line                    |
| `body`            | string | yes      | Email body (**markdown** — see below) |
| `mode`            | string | yes      | `"compose"`, `"reply"`, `"forward"`   |
| `replyToId`       | string | no       | ID of email being replied to          |
| `replyToThreadId` | string | no       | Thread ID for grouping                |

#### Body formatting

The `body` field uses **markdown**. The compose editor (TipTap) renders it as rich text, and the send flow converts it to HTML for the email. Use standard markdown:

- **Links:** `[link text](https://example.com)` — renders as a clickable hyperlink
- **Bold:** `**bold text**`
- **Italic:** `*italic text*`
- **Lists:** `- item` or `1. item`
- **Headings:** `# Heading` (h1–h3)
- **Code:** `` `inline` `` or fenced code blocks
- **Blockquotes:** `> quoted text`
- **Bare URLs:** `https://example.com` auto-links

Do NOT use HTML tags in the body — use markdown only.

## Common Tasks

| User request                      | What to do                                                                                                                                                                 |

## Actions

**IMPORTANT: Always use `pnpm action <name> [--args]` for all mail operations.** Do NOT use `curl`, `fetch`, or raw API calls — scripts handle API communication, error handling, and fallbacks automatically. Scripts work with Gmail when connected and fall back to local data when not.

Scripts use `readAppState()` / `writeAppState()` from `@agent-native/core/application-state` and `readSetting()` / `writeSetting()` from `@agent-native/core/settings` instead of filesystem reads/writes.

## UI Components

**Always use shadcn/ui components** from `app/components/ui/` for all standard UI patterns (dialogs, popovers, dropdowns, tooltips, buttons, etc). Never build custom modals or dropdowns with absolute/fixed positioning — use the shadcn primitives instead.

**Always use Tabler Icons** (`@tabler/icons-react`) for all icons. Never use other icon libraries.

**Never use browser dialogs** (`window.confirm`, `window.alert`, `window.prompt`) — use shadcn AlertDialog instead.

## Deep Links

Artifact-producing and read actions return deep links so an external agent (MCP / A2A) can hand the user a single "Open in Mail →" link that drops them back into the running UI focused on the right record. `manage-draft` (create/update) now returns an object with `id`, `draft`, `deepLink`, and `message` (instead of a bare string) plus a `link` builder that targets the compose draft via a base64url `compose` payload — the open route decodes it into the `compose-<id>` app-state key the compose panel auto-opens. `queue-email-draft` adds a `link` beside the existing `reviewUrl` pointing at `draft-queue` with `queuedDraftId`. `search-emails`, `list-emails`, and `get-thread` are GET + `readOnly` + `publicAgent` and return a list/thread `link` (`view: "inbox"` with `search`/`label`/`threadId` params). `navigate` accepts an optional `--composeDraftId` that lands the user on the inbox so the auto-opening compose panel shows that draft.
