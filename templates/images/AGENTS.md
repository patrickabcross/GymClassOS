# Images Agent

Images manages brand image libraries and generates on-brand assets for this app
and for other agent-native apps over A2A.

## Rules

- All user-facing generation goes through chat. UI buttons submit with
  `sendToAgentChat({ submit: true, newTab: true })`; do not add direct provider
  calls to client components.
- Use image libraries as the source of truth for brand style. Uploaded logos
  and product images are evidence; never invent exact logos from memory.
- Respect library `customInstructions` on every generation. Update them with
  `create-library` / `update-library` when the user wants persistent guidance
  beyond the structured style brief.
- For multiple images, prefer `generate-image-batch` with stable slot IDs.
- For feedback, call `refine-image` with the previous `assetId`; preserve
  lineage instead of regenerating from scratch.
- For other apps, call the Images agent over A2A. If you create or reference an
  image, include the exact `assetId`, `runId`, and returned URLs.
- Every generation creates an audit run. Keep `source` and `callerAppId`
  accurate for cross-agent requests so the design team can inspect usage in
  `/audit`.

## Generation Playbook

- Role-tag references: style, logo, product, diagram, prior candidate.
- Use a small relevant subset by default. Automatic selection samples up to 6
  current references. Pass `referenceAssetIds` only when the exact references
  must be preserved.
- Compile the style brief into prompts: palette, composition, lighting,
  typography policy, subject framing, custom instructions, and explicit
  constraints.
- Generation runs expose `originalPrompt`, `compiledPrompt`, `settingsUsed`,
  `referenceSelection`, and `output`. Use `rerun-generation-run` to test
  changed custom instructions or reference images without retyping the prompt.
- Avoid in-image text unless the user explicitly asks for exact visible text.
- For diagrams, use the normal image path but specify chart type, label
  placement, line weights, hierarchy, and whitespace.
- Builder-managed image generation is enabled by default. Set
  `BUILDER_IMAGE_GENERATION_ENABLED=false` only when a deployment needs to force
  the user-provided Gemini key fallback.
- For logo accuracy, ask the image provider to leave a clean placeholder region
  and composite the canonical uploaded logo server-side.

## Inline Previews

When the chat is in the Images app, embed candidates with:

````
```embed
src: /asset/<assetId>/embed
aspect: 16/9
title: Image candidate
```
````

Cross-app callers should use the `previewUrl` or import/exported asset URL when
same-origin embeds are not available.
