# Project State

## Project Reference

See: `.planning/PROJECT.md` (updated 2026-06-20 — Milestone v2.1 started)
Roadmap: `.planning/ROADMAP.md` (v2.1 section at top; v2.0 collapsed to shipped summary; full v2.0 detail archived in `milestones/v2.0-ROADMAP.md`)
Requirements: `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` (v2.1 requirements, 11 in-scope: CONT-01..05, VID-01..04, PUB-01..04, NAV-01, DEP-01, MIG-01; RENDER-01/02 gated)

**Core value:** HUSTLE staff can author rich content documents and video compositions inside the staff app — with the right-rail agent assisting — and publish them so they reach members (mobile app + public marketing pages), without a new member web portal.

**Current milestone:** v2.1 — Content & Video Studio (staff-web). Started 2026-06-20. Adds `/gymos/content` (Tiptap, non-collab) + `/gymos/video` (Remotion `@remotion/player` editor) tabs to `apps/staff-web`, plus a publish pipeline for member mobile API + public SSR pages.

**Prior art:** `apps/hq` has a non-collab Content surface (BD3 HQD-04: `apps/hq/actions/content-*.ts` + `apps/hq/app/routes/content.*.tsx`) — mine before writing new staff-web content code. The HQ Video surface is a thin deferred stub only (no Remotion dep in `apps/hq`).

## Current Position

Milestone: v2.2 — Meta Conversion Tracking
Phase: MC3 (last phase) — COMPLETE + verified
Plan: —
Status: **v2.2 fully built, verified, and DEPLOYED.** All 3 phases done (15/15 reqs: PIX/CAPI→MC1, LIFE→MC2, LEAD→MC3). Migrations v31–v34 applied to Neon `billowing-sun-51091059` by hand. staff-web (Vercel) + worker/edge (Fly) both live. NOTE: the v2.2 staff-web Vercel build failed silently at first (writeAppSecret MISSING_EXPORT) and only went live after build-fix `126ef375` — see [[project_gymos_deploy]].
Last activity: 2026-06-25 — Completed quick task 260625-mvn (Brain scroll fix + v36 migration) (class sites/locations as studio-global config: resolveSites resolver + sites JSONB column migration v35 + schedule loader threading + NewClassDialog configurable picker + Settings Locations card). 10/10 tests pass, tsc clean, no HUSTLE names in code. DEPLOYED (push bcab86f6); BOTH DB steps DONE by hand on gymos-demo Neon (billowing-sun-51091059): `sites` JSONB column added + singleton row seeded sites=["Norwich","Wymondham"]. Sites now editable via Settings → Integrations → Locations card. Earlier: 260625-d06 (schedule filters: location/class-type/trainer on staff calendar shadcn Popover + public embed native selects). Also resolved a leftover `git stash pop` conflict in `packages/core` tenancy gating (701ba1f1): `isDeployCredentialFallbackAllowed` / `isEnvVarWriteAllowed` now default to single-tenant-per-deploy (allow), with `AGENT_NATIVE_MULTI_TENANT=true` opt-in to restore the upstream gate for the future shared/sharded model. Decision: single-tenant-per-deploy is over-engineered for 1 gym — moving toward a shared/sharded subdomain model (≤10 gyms, shared DB, pseudo-separation) supersedes the old "single-tenant code, multi-tenant deploy" constraint.

**OPEN ITEMS / next-session pickup:**
- **Meta activation parked (user-gated, not done):** (1) `fly secrets set BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=<Vercel value> --config services/edge-webhooks/fly.toml` so the worker can decrypt app_secrets — WITHOUT this every Meta CAPI send + Lead-Ad retrieval silently skips; (2) operator enters Pixel ID + CAPI token + Test Event Code + Page Access Token in `/gymos/settings/integrations`; (3) subscribe the Page's `leadgen` webhook field in Meta to `https://gymos-edge-webhooks.fly.dev/webhooks/meta-lead` (verify token = WHATSAPP_VERIFY_TOKEN). See [[project_gymos_deploy]].
- **Delete stray Vercel project `agent-native-mail-probe`** (vanilla agent-native pg-crash comparison probe, ~31d old, abandoned) — user to delete in Vercel dashboard.
- **Embed cross-origin fix (quick 260624-icd) SHIPPED + verified live** — embed.js CORP=cross-origin, /f/{slug} XFO removed; embeds now work on third-party sites (doyouhustle.co.uk). Hard-refresh the Squarespace page to clear its cached empty state.
- "Next stage" to be defined by user after /clear.

Prior (v2.1):
Status: CV1-CV4 built + committed on master. Full staff-web `tsc` clean (0 errors), 115/115 unit tests pass. **NOT deployed** — production push held for explicit user go-ahead (autonomous run pre-approved build only). CV-RENDER remains gated.
Last activity: 2026-06-24 — Completed quick task 260624-vzw (schedule embed onboarding UI — Share/embed Popover on schedule header; backend already existed). Earlier: 260624-p2x (lead-ack auto-reply middle var → personalized qualifying question, DEPLOYED 2e2b6b0c + confirmed working live; needs 2-slot approved template for clean wording). Earlier: 260624-klo (inline lead-form validation, DEPLOYED 97129e85), 260624-icd (cross-origin embed headers fix). Earlier still: Phase 2 recurring classes (quick 260622-mpv) DONE + DEPLOYED (Vercel + Fly v21, class-materialize cron live). Plus shipped+deployed: WhatsApp template-language fix (en, commit 32abd6cd), editable Forms submit button (14501fd1), conversational template auto-fill (6cfff666). OPEN: WhatsApp "text is required" window-divergence (waiting on MYÜTIK); 5 terminal failed message rows to re-enqueue later. NEXT: Phase 3 (populate HUSTLE timetable) + tracking setup.

> **Open tails from prior milestones:** v2.0 live UAT (BD1–BD4 `*-HUMAN-UAT.md`) deferred-on-external-dependency. v1.2 Agentic Tab Editing live UAT pending (AE1–AE3 deployed). v1.0 Production + Mobile Demo (AE4) remain tracked.

**Progress bar (v2.1):** [██████████] 100% (4/4 active phases, 4/4 plans) — built, not yet deployed

| 260624-klo | Inline per-field validation on public/embed lead form — replace fixed-bottom toast (which covered the CTA in short iframes) with inline `.field-error` under each field + red border/aria-invalid + scroll-to/focus first invalid; toast now only for network/submit failures. Single-file SSR change. DEPLOYED (push 97129e85). | 2026-06-24 | dc7d893d | [260624-klo-improve-validation-error-ux-on-the-publi](./quick/260624-klo-improve-validation-error-ux-on-the-publi/) |
| 260624-vzw | Schedule embed onboarding UI — Share/embed Popover on the staff schedule header (mirrors forms embed): copies `<div data-gymos-schedule></div>`+/embed.js snippet AND the /embed/schedule public link, with copied-state + toast. Backend (/embed/schedule SSR + /embed.js data-gymos-schedule) already existed; this surfaces it to the operator. Single-file (gymos.schedule.tsx), shadcn Popover + Tabler. Live-UI verify pending. | 2026-06-24 | 09704d30 | [260624-vzw-add-share-embed-schedule-affordance-to-s](./quick/260624-vzw-add-share-embed-schedule-affordance-to-s/) |
| 260624-p2x | Lead-ack auto-reply: middle WhatsApp template var ({{2}}) now a personalized qualifying question (class + lead's stated level + ONE open question) instead of a bare class name; prompt rewritten + per-slot cap 60→200, max_tokens 300→400, model unchanged. Needs a 2-slot approved template ("Hey {{1}}, thanks for your interest in {{2}} Feel free to reply here.") + LEAD_ACK_TEMPLATE_NAME pointed at it. Single-file (lead-ack.ts); 6/6 tests pass. | 2026-06-24 | 6dcd05a2 | [260624-p2x-rework-lead-ack-whatsapp-auto-reply-midd](./quick/260624-p2x-rework-lead-ack-whatsapp-auto-reply-midd/) |
| 260625-d06 | Schedule filters — three AND-composed filters (location, class type, trainer) on both the staff calendar (shadcn Popover + Select, client-side over loaded data) and the public embed timetable (native `<select>`, data-* attributes, inline applyFilters() JS). Loader Query A widened with leftJoin(trainers). No schema migration. | 2026-06-25 | 511a4b39 | [260625-d06-add-location-class-type-trainer-filters-](./quick/260625-d06-add-location-class-type-trainer-filters-/) |
| 260625-gsg | Make class sites/locations a studio-global config — pure resolveSites resolver + additive sites JSONB column (migration v35) + schedule loader threading + configurable NewClassDialog picker (replaces hardcoded Norwich/Wymondham) + Settings Locations card with UPSERT action (save-sites-config). 10/10 unit tests pass. REPEATABLE-PER-CLIENT: empty-array default, no gym names in code. TWO manual operator steps required: apply 0007_studio_sites.sql to Neon + seed HUSTLE sites as data. | 2026-06-25 | 107f1e0b | [260625-gsg-make-class-sites-locations-a-studio-glob](./quick/260625-gsg-make-class-sites-locations-a-studio-glob/) |
| 260625-mvn | Brain page scroll fix + durable active-column corrective — migration v36 (guarded idempotent DO block, NO-OP on HUSTLE prod already hotfixed) converts trainers.active + class_schedule_rules.active INTEGER→BOOLEAN with USING(active<>0); schema.ts comment-only update; Brain page both return paths wrapped in h-full overflow-y-auto scroll container mirroring integrations page. | 2026-06-25 | 126445fa | [260625-mvn-fix-brain-page-scroll-durable-corrective](./quick/260625-mvn-fix-brain-page-scroll-durable-corrective/) |

## Accumulated Context

### MC1-03 Decisions (2026-06-23)

- **2026-06-23 MC1-03 — Worker NEVER imports apps/staff-web/server/db/schema.ts.** All `meta_lead_attribution` access from the worker is raw `db.execute(sql\`...\`)` with `// guard:allow-unscoped — worker post-send status write` marker. Separate build boundary — no cross-app Drizzle imports.
- **2026-06-23 MC1-03 — event_time is NOT re-divided in the worker.** `data.eventTime` arrives already as Unix seconds from the submit handler. Dividing by 1000 again would produce a sub-second timestamp broken for Meta.
- **2026-06-23 MC1-03 — test_event_code is a TOP-LEVEL key (sibling of the data array).** Per Meta Graph v23 spec, it must NOT be inside the event object. Setting it inside the event array silently fails Test Events validation.
- **2026-06-23 MC1-03 — BETTER_AUTH_SECRET parity (D-03) deferred to deploy-time.** Boot self-test (D-04) is in place (probes WHATSAPP_ACCESS_TOKEN decrypt; null = prominent error log). Human parity check is a required post-deploy action before CAPI sends can be relied on.
- **2026-06-23 MC1-03 — stageEventMap resolver must be duplicated per build boundary.** It is a pure function with no framework deps — safe to copy. The worker copy lives in services/worker/src/lib/stage-event-map.ts; keep in sync with the staff-web copy when DEFAULT_STAGE_EVENT_MAP changes.
- **2026-06-23 — Phase MC1 complete (all 5 plans).** Next: deploy master → Vercel, complete BETTER_AUTH_SECRET parity check + migration drift check, verify in Meta Test Events, then plan MC2 via `/gsd:plan-phase MC2`.

### v2.1 Roadmap Decisions (2026-06-20)

- **2026-06-20 — Phase prefix CV to avoid .planning/phases/ collisions with BD/AE/R/D/P dirs.**
- **2026-06-20 — 4 active phases (coarse granularity): CV1 Foundation, CV2 Content tab, CV3 Video tab, CV4 Publish pipeline.** CV-RENDER is gated (not part of the default build).
- **2026-06-20 — DEP-01 + MIG-01 + NAV-01 all land in CV1.** These are cross-cutting infrastructure reqs; landing them first unblocks CV2 and CV3 in parallel.
- **2026-06-20 — CV2 and CV3 are independently executable after CV1 completes.** Content and Video don't depend on each other. They can be planned and run in parallel (coarse granularity means one execution order is fine; call `/gsd:plan-phase CV2` then CV3 sequentially).
- **2026-06-20 — CV4 depends on both CV2 (content_documents published state) and CV3 (video_compositions published state).** The publish pipeline needs both entity types to exist.
- **2026-06-20 — Strip Yjs from the Tiptap fork.** The HQ Content surface (BD3-05) already demonstrates the non-collab pattern — copy it. Remove `@tiptap/extension-collaboration`, `@tiptap/extension-collaboration-cursor`, `y-prosemirror`, `yjs`, `y-indexeddb` from the staff-web Tiptap install.
- **2026-06-20 — @remotion/player only (no @remotion/renderer) for CV1-CV4.** `@remotion/renderer` is headless Chromium and requires a server process; it is gated to CV-RENDER. In-browser preview via `@remotion/player` has no server dependency.
- **2026-06-20 — Helper/test files in server/lib, NOT server/plugins.** Nitro bundler error on Vercel if utilities land in server/plugins/ (plugins must export Nitro plugin objects). The HQ BD-series phases all followed this rule.
- **2026-06-20 — Prior art for Content actions: apps/hq/actions/content-{create,list,get,update}-document.ts (forked from templates/content in BD3-05).** Use as the direct copy-and-adapt base. The main changes needed for staff-web: (a) remove ownableColumns/accessFilter (gym tables are single-tenant, use guard:allow-unscoped); (b) add `status` field (draft/published) not present in HQ version; (c) rename deepLink app from 'content' to match staff-web navigation.
- **2026-06-20 — No member web portal constraint is the governing constraint for CV4.** `/c/:slug` public SSR page and `/api/m/content` member API are the delivery mechanisms; no new member login-required routes inside /gymos.
- **2026-06-20 — RENDER-01 / RENDER-02 mapped to gated CV-RENDER phase.** Not counted in the default coverage total (11 in-scope reqs across CV1-CV4). Gated phase requires explicit go-ahead + infra planning before `/gsd:plan-phase CV-RENDER`.

### CV2-01 Decisions (2026-06-20)

- **2026-06-20 CV2-01 — actions-registry.ts is gitignored (auto-generated); content-* actions auto-discovered on next dev/build start.** Updated registry locally for tsc; do not commit.
- **2026-06-20 CV2-01 — slugify("café & co") = "caf-co": strip non-ASCII as single codepoints (no NFD normalization first).** é is U+00E9 single codepoint; removed entirely rather than decomposed to e + combining accent. All 8 slug unit tests assert this exact output.
- **2026-06-20 CV2-01 — @tiptap/extension-link imported as Link_ to avoid shadowing React Router Link.** Cosmetic alias only; no functional impact.
- **2026-06-20 CV2-01 — Hard delete on content-delete-document (no soft-delete/deleted_at column).** Per plan hard_constraints; delete is always behind shadcn AlertDialog in UI; no new migration needed.

### BD4-01 Decisions (2026-06-19) — preserved for reference

- **2026-06-19 BD4-01 — All three BD4 tables owned by BD4-01 to prevent db.ts collision with BD4-02: studio_brain_docs (v16), studio_owner_config (v17), reactivation_attempts (v18), index (v19) all in BD4-01; BD4-02 reads them without touching db.ts.**
- **2026-06-19 BD4-01 — Pure helper extraction to brain-init-helpers.ts: vitest.unit.config.ts + ESM vitest cannot import @agent-native/core (CJS React "module is not defined"); pure helpers extracted to *-helpers.ts (mirrors create-checkout-link-helpers.ts pattern).**
- **2026-06-19 BD4-01 — Collapsible shadcn primitive for Class Methods: progressive disclosure — Class Methods section collapsed by default on /gymos/brain per AGENTS.md rule.**
- **2026-06-19 BD4-01 — Client-side fetch in gymos.brain.tsx (no loader): readAppState and getDb() in a React Router v7 loader need request context; client-side pattern matches gymos.campaigns.tsx segment-fetch.**

### v2.0 Roadmap Decisions — preserved for reference

- **2026-06-19 — Phase prefix BD (not integer) to avoid .planning/phases/ collisions with existing AE/R/D/P phase directories.**
- **2026-06-19 — 4 phases (coarse granularity).** Research converged on BD1-BD4. BD2 and BD4 each contain two parallel plans within the phase (TEL+PROV in BD2; GOB+GOD in BD4).
- **2026-06-19 — Provisioner runs in services/hq-worker (Fly), not Vercel.** 8-step saga exceeds Vercel's 300-second timeout. pg-boss job in hq-worker drives forward steps and LIFO rollback.
- **2026-06-19 — PROV rollback code ships before happy-path code (CRITICAL).** Non-idempotent provisioning creates orphaned cloud resources.
- **2026-06-19 — Three PII-up enforcement mechanisms (all three must ship together in BD1/BD2).**
- **2026-06-19 — HQ needs its own WABA (separate from any studio WABA).**
- **2026-06-19 — Anthropic call-site audit is a BD1 task, not BD2.**
- **2026-06-19 — Meta template approval lead times are calendar dependencies, not engineering tasks.**
- **2026-06-19 — GOD suppression ceiling (3 attempts / 90-day window) ships from day one (Pitfall W-01).**
- **2026-06-19 — GOD heartbeat cron start times staggered by hash(studio_id) % 60 min (Pitfall W-02).**
- **2026-06-19 — `sendMessage.ts` is NOT modified in BD4.**
- **2026-06-19 — HQ org + super-admin seed row in runMigrations (Pitfall F-02).**

### v1.2 Roadmap Decisions — preserved for reference

- **2026-06-18 — Phase prefix AE to avoid .planning/phases/ collisions.**
- **2026-06-18 — Gate atomicity: new gated actions must update both `ACTION_ALLOWLIST` in `approve-proposal.ts` AND Zod enum in `propose-action.ts` in the same commit.**
- **2026-06-18 — Consent exclusion is structural (`.strict()` Zod schema), not behavioral.**
- **2026-06-18 — Cancel-occurrence correctness: BOOKINGS_EXIST guard + atomic transaction.**
- **2026-06-18 — No local dev server constraint continues (NitroViteError).**
- **2026-06-18 — Two-exposure rule per action: action file registry + system prompt bullet, both required.**

### v1.0 Accumulated Context — preserved for reference

**P1c-WIDE VERIFICATION CONSTRAINT:** The local `agent-native dev` server cannot boot (`NitroViteError: Vite environment "nitro" is unavailable` -> 503 on server routes). NO plan can run a local HTTP walkthrough. Verify via replay against live Neon DB via Neon MCP or defer to e2e smoke test on Vercel deploy.

- **2026-05-17 — Two-milestone restructure:** Demo Sprint (week 1) + Production v1 (weeks 2-9).
- **2026-05-17 — pg-boss on Neon (NOT BullMQ + Redis):** Queue lives in same Neon DB; no Redis service.
- **2026-05-17 — Calorie counter built fresh (NOT fork OpenNutriTracker):** OpenNutriTracker is Flutter + GPL v3.
- **2026-05-17 (late) — Member surface = Expo fork of `packages/mobile-app`** (NOT web PWA).

**Live deployment state (master):**

- Staff-web: `https://gym-class-os.vercel.app` (Vercel, auto-deploys from `master`). As of 2026-06-22 (commit `082854ba`): **RunStudio rebrand live**; 4 localized marketing homepages live at `/ /uk /us /fr /de` (FR/DE native); Content tab hidden; video brief pipeline stages 1-2 live; v2.1 Content/Video Studio live. **Deploy = git push to master ONLY** (the `vercel` CLI fails — monorepo source > 10 MB upload cap; and NO root `.vercelignore` — it breaks the `packages/core` build).
- Staff-web (history): AE3 live as of commit `120d11c3`, deployed 2026-06-19
- Worker + edge-webhooks: Fly app `gymos-edge-webhooks`
- Neon project: `gymos-demo` (id `billowing-sun-51091059`)
- Demo data: 260 members / 423 class occurrences / 4,162 bookings / 200 active subs / 90 conversations / 453 messages

### PICK UP HERE — plan MC1

v2.2 roadmap is written (Meta Conversion Tracking). Three phases MC1-MC3 defined with success criteria + requirement mappings (16 reqs). No implementation yet.

**Next step — plan Phase MC1 (Foundation + Lead event):** `/gsd:plan-phase MC1`

MC1 hook points (confirmed by codebase map 2026-06-23):

- Browser Pixel + fbc/fbp/fbclid capture → `apps/staff-web/features/forms/lib/public-form-ssr.ts` (the `/f/:slug` page) + `apps/staff-web/features/forms/lib/embed-snippet.ts` (`/embed.js` — parent→iframe bridge for fbclid + consent).
- Extend submit payload + persist + enqueue → `apps/staff-web/features/forms/handlers/submissions.ts` (`submitLeadForm`).
- New additive `meta_lead_attribution` table → `apps/staff-web/server/db/schema.ts` + a new `runMigrations` version (NOT auto-run — apply to gymos-demo Neon by hand per migration-drift gotcha).
- Studio config (pixelId/stageEventMap/testEventCode) → `studio_brain_docs` pattern (mirror `tenant-brand-resolver.ts`); `META_CAPI_TOKEN` → `registerRequiredSecret` in `apps/staff-web/server/register-secrets.ts`, read via `apps/staff-web/server/lib/app-secrets.ts`.
- Settings card → `/gymos/settings/integrations` (next to Stripe Connect).
- `meta-capi-event` queue → `packages/queue/src/{types,publish}.ts` + register in `services/worker/src/index.ts`; worker sender modeled on `services/worker/src/queues/telemetry-push.ts` (env-gated, throw-to-retry) + `sendViaMyutik.ts` (status-carrying errors). Worker needs `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` Fly secret to decrypt the CAPI token.
- MC2 hooks (later): `services/worker/src/domain/conversations.ts` + `queues/inbound-whatsapp.ts` (Contact); `services/worker/src/domain/stripeReducers/` checkout-session-completed + invoice.paid (Purchase, value/currency); `bookings.status='attended'` write (Schedule).

### Prior pickup (v2.1 — reference only)

**Next step — plan Phase CV1:** `/gsd:plan-phase CV1`

CV1 is the foundational phase: Tiptap (no collab) + `@remotion/player` deps installed in `apps/staff-web/package.json`; additive `content_documents` + `video_compositions` `runMigrations` versions; `features/content/` + `features/video/` scaffolded from templates; Content + Video tabs added to `GymosTopNav`; `application_state` updated for context-awareness; tsc + Nitro build verified clean.

**Prior art to mine at plan time:**

- `apps/hq/actions/content-{create,list,get,update}-document.ts` — BD3-05 non-collab Content fork; adapt imports + add `status` field + remove `ownableColumns`/`accessFilter` (use `guard:allow-unscoped`)
- `apps/hq/app/routes/content._index.tsx` + `content.$id.tsx` — list + editor UI; adapt to staff-web gymos route conventions
- `apps/hq/server/lib/documents.ts` — `parseDocumentFavorite` helper; copy into `apps/staff-web/server/lib/`
- `apps/hq/app/routes/content.video.tsx` — thin stub only (no Remotion); CV1 scaffold can be similarly thin; CV3 adds `@remotion/player`

**CV2 + CV3 can be planned in parallel after CV1 completes** (no dependency between them). CV4 depends on both.

**RENDER go-ahead note:** If server-side MP4 render is approved at any point, run `/gsd:plan-phase CV-RENDER`. The gated phase is fully specified in ROADMAP.md (RENDER-01/RENDER-02) but blocked on explicit infra/cost decision.
